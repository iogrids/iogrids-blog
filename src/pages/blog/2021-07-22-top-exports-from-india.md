India has been exporting most of the above products to countries like Nepal, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Kuwait etc. To be successful in exports the main stategy is to identify and export to countries where the competition is less.   If you choose the wrong product or the select the wrong country to export your export business can lead to a disaster.

If you are just starting out I would always suggest to export products which is less compeitive. I would suggest you to read [theempireexporter.com](theempireexporter.com) or [Import Export Business by Jason Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Your-Export-Business-Startup/dp/1599186721/ref=sr_1_2) which can be of great help.
